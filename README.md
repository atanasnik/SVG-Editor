# SVG-Editor
SVG file editor - a small project for my Object-oriented programming course.

## Short description
The editor supports three types of geometric shapes - a line, a circle, and a
rectangle. Operations on shapes: creating, deleting, translating, checking if
a point is within a shape, checking if a shape is within another shape
(a circle or a rectangle), calculating and printing the shapes' areas and
perimeters.

## Notes
The project is striving to follow the OOP principles. Its main purpose is to
practice polymorphism and work with heterogeneous containers.
